        <h2 id="rules">The Rules</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Basketball is a team sport.</li>
          <li>Two teams of five players each try to score by shooting a ball through a hoop elevated 10 feet above the ground.</li>
          <li>The game is played on a rectangular floor called the court, and there is a hoop at each end.</li>
          <li>The court is divided into two main sections by the mid-court line.</li>
          <li>If the offensive team puts the ball into play behind the mid-court line, it has ten seconds to get the ball over the mid-court line.</li>
          <li>If it doesn't, then the defense gets the ball.</li>
          <li>Once the offensive team gets the ball over the mid-court line, it can no longer have possession of the ball in the area behind the midcourt line.</li>
          <li>If it does, the defense is awarded the ball.</li>
          <li>The ball is moved down the court toward the basket by passing or dribbling. The team with the ball is called the offense. The team without the ball is called the defense.</li>
          <li>The defense tries to steal the ball, contest shots, deflect passes, and garner rebounds.</li>
        </ul>
       
        <h2 id="termino">Basic Terminology</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hoop/basket:</span> If the ball goes in the hoop with the net, the offensive team scores. The glass, or backboard is the back of the hoop.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dribble:</span> Bouncing the ball off of the court (the floor). Players must dribble to move the ball. If you don’t dribble and you move your feet, it’s a traveling foul.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Free throw:</span> When a player is fouled while shooting, they get to shoot free throws. These are worth 1 point each.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Jump ball:</span> This is how you start the game. The ball is thrown into the air and players try to tip it to their team. This event is called the tip off.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The paint:</span> Also known as the interior, this is the area closest to the hoop. It is outlined by a rectangle. The two big squares near the bottom are the block. The top line is the free throw line.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The arc:</span> Also known as the three point line, this is the round line on the ground surrounding the paint. Making the ball from behind this line is 3 points, not 2.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Jumper/jump shot:</span> This is any shot outside of the paint. Other types of shot include dunks, where you slam the ball through the hoop, and layups where you attack the hoop and try to gently drop the ball in.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="position">Standard positions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Point guard:</span> Typically the fastest player on the team, the point guard brings the ball up the court. A good point guard is great at dribbling and passing.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shooting guard:</span> The shooting guard stays near the top of the court with the point guard. They’re usually the best outside shooter on their team, as the name implies.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Small forward:</span> The small forward is usually a versatile player who is equally good at shooting, dribbling, passing, and defense.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Power forward:</span> The power forward is a tall player who should be good at fighting in the paint, rebounding, and shooting close to the hoop.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Center:</span> Typically the tallest player on the team, the center’s main job is typically to rebound the ball and block shots.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="clock">Game clock</h2>
        <p>
          Each game is divided into sections, and all levels have two halves.<br><br>
          In college, each half is twenty minutes long.<br><br>
          In high school and below, the halves are divided into eight (and sometimes, six) minute quarters. In the pros, quarters are twelve minutes long.<br><br>
          There is a gap of several minutes between halves. Gaps between quarters are relatively short.<br><br>
          If the score is tied at the end of regulation, then overtime periods of various lengths are played until a winner emerges.
        </p>

        <h2 id="points">Score points</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inside of the arc, every shot is worth 2 points.</li>
          <li>Outside of the arc, any jump shot is worth 3 points. Some outdoor courts and smaller courts won’t have this line.</li>
          <li>If you get fouled while shooting, you shoot free throws. Every free throw is worth 1 point. You get 2 free throws for a 2-point shot, or 3 free throws for a 3-point shot. If you make the shot where you’re fouled, it counts for 2 or 3 points and then you get 1 extra free throw.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="ball">About ball move</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If you stop dribbling, you cannot re-start dribbling. Dribbling again is a foul known as double dribbling.</li>
          <li>If you're driving in to shoot, you can pick up the ball and take two steps without dribbling before you shoot or pass. More than two steps is a foul called traveling.</li>
          <li>You can still jump to shoot or pass, but when you come back down you need to have gotten rid of the ball.</li>
          <li>When you start dribbling, you must dribble constantly as you move, until you pass, shoot, or stop dribbling to plant on your pivot foot.</li>
        </ul>
