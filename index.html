            &emsp;&emsp;Basketball is a game played by two teams of five players each on a rectangular court, usually indoors. Each team tries to score by tossing the ball through the opponentâ€™s goal, an elevated horizontal hoop and net called a basket.</p>

            &emsp;&emsp;The game of basketball was invented in 1891. Naismith focused on creating a non-contact sport to be played indoors and developed the rules, which he published in January 1892 in The Triangle, the school newspaper of Springfield College.</p>

          <h2 id="who">Who</h2>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;Dr. James Naismith was a 31-year-old graduate student at the YMCA International Training School (now known as Springfield College). He is a Canadian physical education instructor.</p>

          <h2 id="why">Why</h2>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;Dr. James Naismith was tasked to create an indoor sports game to help athletes keep in shape as they endured the cold weather in winter. His vision was to craft an indoor activity that would be enjoyable and beneficial for his students.</p>
