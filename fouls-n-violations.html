        <h1>Fouls and Violations</h1>
        <h2 id="fouls">Personal fouls</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hitting:</span> Refers to illegal physical contact made by a player against an opponent, often involving hitting or striking the body. This can occur during various situations on the court, such as when attempting to block a shot, steal the ball, or defend against opponent.

          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pushing:</span> When a player uses their hands, arms, or body to push an opponent, impeding their movement or gaining an unfair advantage. It's considered a violation of the rules and typically results in a foul being called by the referees. Depending on the severity and context of the push, it can lead to various penalties, such as free throws or ball possession awarded to the opposing team.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Slapping:</span> When a player uses their hand and arm to slap or strike an opponent, either intentionally or unintentionally. This action is considered illegal and is typically called by referees as a foul. Slapping often happen during attemtps to steal the ball or while defending against an opponent.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Holding:</span> When a player grabs or holds onto an opponent, impeding their movement or preventing them from freely participating in the game. Holding are considered illegal and are typically called by referees when they occur. This type of foul often happens when players are jockeying for position, rebounding, or trying o defend against an opponent. Depending on the severity and context of the foul, penalties can range from a simple turnover to free throws or ball possession being awarded to the opposing team.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Illegal pick/screen:</span> When an offensive player is moving. When an offensive player sticks out a limb and makes physical contact with a defender in an attempt to block the path of the defender.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="penalties">Personal foul penalties</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;If a player is shooting while a being fouled, then he gets two free throws if his shot doesn't go in, but only one free throw if his shot does go in.
        </p><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Three free throws are awarded if the player is fouled while shooting for a three-point goal and they miss their shot. If a player is fouled while shooting a three-point shot and makes it anyway, he is awarded one free throw. Thus, he could score four points on the play.</li><br>
          <li>Inbounds. If fouled while not shooting, the ball is given to the team the foul was committed upon. They get the ball at the nearest side or baseline, out of bounds, and have 5 seconds to pass the ball onto the court.</li><br>
          <li>One & one. If the team committing the foul has seven or more fouls in the game, then the player who was fouled is awarded one free throw. If he makes his first shot, then he is awarded another free throw.</li><br>
          <li>Ten or more fouls. If the team committing the foul has ten or more fouls, then the fouled player receives two free throws.</li><br>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="charging">Charging</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;An offensive foul that is committed when a player pushes or runs over a defensive player. The ball is given to the team that the foul was committed upon.
        </p>

        <h2 id="blocking">Blocking</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Blocking is illegal personal contact resulting from a defender not establishing position in time to prevent an opponent's drive to the basket.
        </p>

        <h2 id="flagrant">Flagrant foul</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Violent contact with an opponent. This includes hitting, kicking, and punching. This type of foul results in free throws plus the offense retaining possession of the ball after the free throws.
        </p>

        <h2 id="intentional">Intentional foul</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;When a player makes physical contact with another player with no reasonable effort to steal the ball. It is a judgment call for the officials.
        </p>

        <h2 id="technical">Technical foul</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Technical foul. A player or a coach can commit this type of foul. It does not involve player contact or the ball but is instead about the 'manners' of the game. Foul language, obscenity, obscene gestures, and even arguing can be considered a technical foul, as can technical details regarding filling in the scorebook improperly or dunking during warm-ups.
        </p><br>

        <h2>VIOLATIONS</h2><br>
        
        <h2 id="walking">Walking/traveling</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Taking more than 'a step and a half' without dribbling the ball is traveling. Moving your pivot foot once you've stopped dribbling is traveling.
        </p>

        <h2 id="carrying">Carrying/palming</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;When a player dribbles the ball with his hand too far to the side of or, sometimes, even under the ball.
        </p>

        <h2 id="double">Double dribble</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Dribbling the ball with both hands on the ball at the same time or picking up the dribble and then dribbling again is a double dribble.
        </p>

        <h2 id="held">Held ball</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Occasionally, two or more opposing players will gain possession of the ball at the same time. In order to avoid a prolonged and/or violent tussle, the referee stops the action and awards the ball to one team or the other on a rotating basis.
        </p>

        <h2 id="goaltending">Goaltending</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;If a defensive player interferes with a shot while it's on the way down toward the basket, while it's on the way up toward the basket after having touched the backboard, or while it's in the cylinder above the rim, it's goaltending and the shot counts. If committed by an offensive player, it's a violation and the ball is awarded to the opposing team for a throw-in.
        </p>

        <h2 id="backcourt">Backcourt violation</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;Once the offense has brought the ball across the mid-court line, they cannot go back across the line during possession. If they do, the ball is awarded to the other team to pass inbounds.
        </p>

        <h2 id="time">Time restrictions</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;A player passing the ball inbounds has five seconds to pass the ball. If he does not, then the ball is awarded to the other team. Other time restrictions include the rule that a player cannot have the ball for more than five seconds when being closely guarded and, in some states and levels, shot-clock restrictions requiring a team to attempt a shot within a given time frame.
